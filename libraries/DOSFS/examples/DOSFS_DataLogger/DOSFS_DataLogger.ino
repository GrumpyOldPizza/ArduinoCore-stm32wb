/* DOSFS datalogger
 *
 * This example shows how to log data to a DOSFS file
 *
 * Please select in the "Tools->DOSFS" menu either
 * SDCARD or SFLASH. Make sure that "Tools->USB Type"
 * does not contain "Mass Storage". 
 *
 * Kind of simple and a tad boring. The temperature sensor
 * is read and then the data appended to a logfile. There
 * are however a few interesting details internally. The
 * log file is closed after each dataset. That has 2 effects.
 * One is that the if the crashes or gets reset there is no
 * file system corruption. The other important detail is 
 * that if no wok is pending, the SDCARD/SFLASH can go
 * to sleep, hence consuming less power.
 *
 * This example code is in the public domain.
